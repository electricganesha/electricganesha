My name is [Christian](https://www.christianmarques.com) and I'm a full-time software engineer (full-stack Javascript), published poet, amateur musician, and hobbyist photographer.

I graduated (B.Sc.) in Computer Science from the [Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/), and completed my M.Sc. in Information Systems in the same institution. I spent one full year at the [Polytechnic Institute of Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en) (Barcelona) through the European interchange programme [Erasmus Mundus](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/erasmus-mundus-joint-masters).

I am interested in topics as wide as web development, computer graphics, video-game design, crypto-currency/fintech, artificial intelligence, data science, artificial life, literature, cinema, music and philosophy.

I have worked in various types of organizations (academic, multinational, startup, etc). I often volunteer for projects that might have some meaning to me, but I am also open to providing services as a contractor - mostly for web projects, but also video games, or others, so if you have a project that you think would be interesting to discuss, do get in touch and we can talk about it.

- 🦷 I’m currently working at [Promaton](https://www.promaton.com/) as a front-end engineer developing advanced AI-driven 3D interfaces and visualisations for the dental industry.
- 🛍️ I worked for ~5 years at [Trouva](https://www.trouva.com) as a full-stack engineer (mostly front-end) developing and maintaining a complex international e-commerce platform with B2C and B2B facing applications.
- 🥽 Together with [PUSHVFX](https://www.pushvfx.com/), for ~2 years, we tried our shot at Virtual Reality and 3D on the web, during which we developed some cool projects for Vodafone and other clients.
- ✈️ I worked for ~3 years at [Amadeus](https://amadeus.com/en) as a back-end engineer on the Payment team where I worked on Credit Card payments and developing Pay-With-Miles systems.
- 🧪 I worked for ~2 years at the research laboratory [LabMAG (Laboratório de Modelação de Agentes)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/labmag---laboratory-of-agent-modelling/), where after delivering my thesis, I continued working on a project [NAADIR](https://www.lasige.pt/project/naadir/)

- 🎮 I love video games and have participated in at least 4 [Global Game Jams](https://globalgamejam.org/) producing some projects that I'm proud of, and which you can see [here on my itch.io page](https://electricganesha.itch.io/) 
- 🌐 Apart from these, I have played around with a lot of different projects, which you can find on [my website](https://www.christianmarques.com), feel free to take a look.
